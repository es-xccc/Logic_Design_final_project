2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_div and sys_clk_pin are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch direction_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin direction_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
